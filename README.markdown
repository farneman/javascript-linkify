# New In This Fork: #

This fork aggregates work from two other forks. It also fixes an caused when
linkify is given a string with no links in it.

# From @eliellis: #

Updated the Top Level Domain list.

# Added By @mahemoff: #

## Twitter option

    linkify('@mahemoff', { twitter: true })
becomes:
    <a href="http://twitter.com/mahemoff" title="http://twitter.com/mahemoff">@mahemoff</a>

In doing so, there's some refactoring to simplify the way the uber URI regexp is built up.
There's also some basic support for Node and a tiny test (in CoffeeScript).

## Attribs option

    linkify('a.com b.com', { attribs: { target: '_blank' } })
becomes:
    <a href="http://a.com" title="http://a.com target="_blank' >a.com</a> <a href="http://b.com" title="http://b.com target="_blank' >b.com</a>

Note these links have target='_blank' as an extra attribute, in addition to the regular href and title.
